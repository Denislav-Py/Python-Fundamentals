#   You will be receiving names until the command "Welcome!". The length of each name determines in which house the student is going:
#	If the name is less than 5 chars, the student is going into Gryffindor
#	Print "{name} goes to Gryffindor."
#	If the name is exactly 5 chars, the student is going into Slytherin
#	Print "{name} goes to Slytherin."
#	If the name is exactly 6 chars, the student is going into Ravenclaw
#	Print "{name} goes to Ravenclaw."
#	If the name is more than 6 chars, the student is going into Hufflepuff
#	Print "{name} goes to Hufflepuff."
#   While receiving names, if you receive "Voldemort", print "You must not speak of that name!" and end the program. No more sorting for today!
#   If all students are sorted successfully, print "Welcome to Hogwarts."
